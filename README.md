# Raghu Vijaykumar

I am a Software Engineer with nearly 9 years of experience in cloud computing, distributed systems, and data platforms. My expertise lies in designing and implementing scalable, high-performance solutions while optimizing system efficiency. I have a strong background in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS), with hands-on experience in building robust infrastructures, enhancing system performance, and implementing DevOps practices. My work also extends to security, system design, and developing innovative tools, such as AI-powered chatbots and data ingestion pipelines.

At **Equifax**, I led platform solutions for multiple products, significantly improving system performance by transitioning to Kinesis Streams and enhancing ingestion processes using Datastream and Terraform. I also developed a chatbot and SQL agent leveraging Streamlit, Redis, and LLMs to process BigQuery insights. My efforts ensured robust multi-cloud infrastructure, processing millions of daily transactions while maintaining high availability and disaster recovery.

At **Boeing**, I consolidated microservices, streamlined deployment processes with Kubernetes and Helm, and optimized BigQuery storage, achieving substantial cost savings. Additionally, I developed Apache Beam pipelines for processing large-scale flight data, built a unified data ingestion layer for airline operators, and conducted sentiment analysis to improve employee satisfaction. These contributions earned multiple awards for outstanding performance.

Beyond work, I enjoy cycling, swimming, exploring new restaurants, and sharing my experiences through detailed reviews. My technical acumen and passion for solving complex problems drive me to seek opportunities to innovate and make meaningful contributions to the tech industry.
